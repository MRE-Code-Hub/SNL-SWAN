Project Overview
====================

SNL-SWAN (Sandia National Laboratories – Simulating WAves Nearshore) is an open source wave energy converter (WEC) array simulation tool. The code is a modification of the open source code, SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) developed by TU Delft. The SNL-SWAN code includes the addition of a WEC Module which improves how SWAN accounts for power performance of WECs and the effects on the wave field. For more information on the implementation and application of SNL-SWAN, please refer to the SNL-SWAN Manual. The SNL-SWAN project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Wind and Water Power Technologies Office. To submit feedback on the development of SNL-SWAN.
